      <div className="text">
        <p>Your investment goals and risk tolerance should also be taken into account. You run a serious risk of losing all of your invested money when you trade Forex and derivatives. Never risk capital you cannot afford to lose. Because leverage magnifies price changes, items like forex and derivatives can result in both gains and losses that are greater than they otherwise would be. Forex and derivatives trading may not be appropriate for all investors.

          If you are unsure of the dangers associated with trading forex and derivative products, please seek independent, expert financial advice.

          'Complex financial instruments' refer to products like forex, derivatives, and cryptocurrencies. These are high-risk investments that require a good understanding of the risks involved.
          Complex financial instruments can be difficult to sell quickly, making them less 'readily realisable.' This is especially true for derivatives and cryptocurrencies.
          On the True Trade Pro trading platform, you can trade complex financial products like:

          •	Rolling Spot Forex
          •	Contract for Difference (CFD)
          •	Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum

          These products can be challenging to understand and come with significant risks. Make sure you are aware of these risks before trading.

      <br />
      <div className="text">
        <p>Trading in financial markets involves exposure to market risk. Market risk, also known as systematic risk, is a fundamental aspect of trading in financial markets. Market conditions can fluctuate rapidly, leading to significant gains or losses on investments.

          Factors such as:
          •	Economic indicators - GDP growth, inflation rates, employment data and central bank policies directly impact market sentiment and asset prices. Changes in these indicators can trigger volatility and affect the performance of financial instruments. For instance, an unexpected increase in inflation may lead to interest hikes by central banks, influencing currency value and bond yields.
          •	 Geopolitical events – such as geopolitical tensions, wars, terrorist attacks, or political instability, can disrupt global financial markets. These events often lead to heightened uncertainty, flight to safe-haven assets, and abrupt shifts in investor sentiment. Traders should remain vigilant of geopolitical developments and their potential ramifications on market dynamics.
          •	Market sentiment: Market sentiment refers to the collective mood or attitude of investors towards a particular asset or financial market. It can be influenced by news, rumors, and investor behavior. Positive sentiment may drive bullish trends, while negative sentiment can lead to bearish movements.
          •	Seasonal Factors: Certain financial markets exhibit seasonal patterns influenced by factors such as holidays, agricultural cycles, or fiscal year-end activities. These seasonal trends can affect market liquidity, trading volumes, and price movements. Traders should be mindful of seasonal variations and their potential impact on market behavior.
          •	Global events: including natural disasters, pandemics, and macroeconomic developments, can have significant repercussions on financial markets. For example, the outbreak of a global health crisis may trigger market volatility, disrupt supply chains, and lead to widespread economic uncertainty. Traders should assess the potential implications of such events on their trading positions.
          •	Financial Instruments Correlation: The correlation between different financial instruments can influence market risk. Some assets exhibit strong positive or negative correlations with others, impacting portfolio diversification and risk management strategies. Understanding the interplay between correlated assets is essential for mitigating portfolio risk and optimizing investment returns.
          •	Black Swan Events: Black swan events are rare and unpredictable occurrences with severe and widespread consequences. These events, such as financial market crashes, sovereign defaults, or technological disruptions, can catch investors off-guard and cause significant market disruptions. While it is challenging to anticipate black swan events, traders should adopt risk mitigation strategies to minimize their impact on portfolio performance.

          Margin Trading
        </h4>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div className="text">
        <p>The amount of money needed to open a position is known as margin, and it is determined by the margin rate. Margin trading is a high-risk trading technique that enables you to trade with more money than a company keeps for you as "margin" This is often referred to as "leverage" or "leveraged trading," and it means that you can make transactions worth more than the little sum of money you have put as margin. If the price changes in your favour when you are trading on margin, you could realise large profits. However, even a slight price change against you might result in significant losses.

          If this occurs, you might be given a "Margin Call" and asked to deposit extra margin with us right away in order to keep these transactions open. Failure to meet a Margin Call may result in the forced closure of your positions. You are responsible for making sure you consistently deposit enough margin as well as for any losses you might sustain when your positions are closed. Margin trading has no upper limit on possible losses or gains, therefore you should constantly keep that in mind while making trading decisions.

          Margin trading entails a significant level of capital risk, making it unsuitable for all investors. Please make sure you fully understand the risks associated in margin trading before deciding to engage in any trading and obtain independent advice if necessary.

          You should make sure you have enough resources on hand to cover any negative changes in the price of the margined product, any margin requirements, or any loss because there is no cap on the losses you may suffer.

          Use risk-reducing strategies like those described below to manage exposure:

          1.	When using leverage, employ "stop loss" or "limit" orders to reduce possible losses. Limit and stop-loss orders are not guaranteed; pricing discrepancies could result in your stop-loss orders being filled at a less favourable price, and you could experience losses that are greater than your initial investment.

          2.	Reduce your leverage to set a larger margin requirement for yourself. By doing this, you will be less tempted to take positions with more leverage than you are comfortable with. Additionally, a potential margin closeout will become more apparent to you.

          3.	Keep an ongoing eye on the state of your account and open positions.

          Additional Deposits
        </h4>
      </div>

      <div className="text">
        <p>

          To initiate a trade, you must deposit a margin with the company, and it is your obligation to make sure you have adequate margin to cover all of your open positions.  In the event of insufficient margin, you are obligated to either deposit additional funds with us to sustain the position or close the trade to reduce your margin requirement.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          We reserve the right to close your transaction on your behalf if you fail to maintain the required margin, and you agree to bear the risk of any resulting losses.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          It is important to carefully monitor your margin levels and account balance to avoid margin calls and potential liquidation of positions. Ensuring sufficient margin coverage is essential to managing risk effectively and preserving capital in volatile market conditions.

          Rolling Spot Forex Contract
        </h4>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div className="text">
        <p>

          A Rolling Spot Forex Contract is a type of speculative agreement where investors profit from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. No actual currency is exchanged until the contract is closed, allowing for indefinite 'rolling' of positions. Both parties are exposed to changes in currency values throughout the contract term.

          Contract for Differences (CFD)
        </h4>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div className="text">
        <p>

          A Contract for Difference (CFD) is an agreement where you trade the difference between the opening and closing values of a contract. Instead of buying or selling the underlying asset, you trade with a CFD provider. This means you don't own the asset itself, but your CFD's price mirrors the underlying asset's price. So, when the asset's price changes, you can make a profit or a loss. The profit or loss is calculated by multiplying the number of underlying instruments by the difference between the opening and closing prices of the CFD.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          CFDs allow you to trade without directly owning the asset, making it possible to profit from both upward and downward price movements in financial markets. However, if your potential losses exceed the margin you've deposited with us, you may need to close your positions, possibly at unfavourable times.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          Additionally, it's important to note that a CFD is a "principal-to-principal" contract. Once you've opened a position, you can't close it with a different party, even if it would have been more profitable to do so.

      </div>
      <br />
      <div className="text">
        <p>

          Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security and operate on decentralized networks based on blockchain technology. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments, cryptocurrencies are typically decentralized and not controlled by any central authority.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          When you own cryptocurrency, you have a digital asset stored in a digital wallet. Transactions involving cryptocurrencies are recorded on a public ledger called a blockchain, which ensures transparency and security.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          Cryptocurrencies can be used for various purposes, including online purchases, investment, remittances, and as a means of transferring value across borders. Some popular cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, and many others.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          Investing in cryptocurrencies carries risks due to their volatile nature. Prices can fluctuate significantly within short periods, leading to potential gains or losses for investors. Additionally, cryptocurrencies face regulatory, security, and technological risks that investors should consider.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          Despite the risks, cryptocurrencies have gained popularity as an alternative asset class and have the potential to revolutionize various industries through blockchain technology. However, it's essential for investors to conduct thorough research and understand the risks before investing in cryptocurrencies.

          Exchange Risk
        </h4>
      </div>


      <div className="text">
        <p>

          Exchange risk is a concern in regard to forex and derivative. Exchange risk, commonly referred to as "currency risk," is the possibility of suffering a loss (or profit) due to unanticipated changes in exchange rates (the costs at which different currencies are traded). There is a chance that a negative movement in exchange rates may force you to finish either a long or short position in a foreign currency at a loss. It can also be referred to as the risk of unknown returns when buying stocks in a currency other than your own.

      <div className="heading">
        <h4>
          Liquidity Risk
        </h4>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div className="text">
        <p>

          'Liquidity risk' is a risk that applies to forex and derivatives. A circumstance in which an investor who wants to trade a security is prevented from doing so because no one else on the market is interested in doing so is known as a liquidity risk. Finding purchasers with the necessary terms is difficult. It also includes the risk associated with an investment's lack of marketability, which makes it unable to purchase or sell it quickly enough to avoid or reduce a loss.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          Non-highly traded assets are more prone to liquidity risk since it may be difficult to sell an investment without taking a sizable loss on the current market value. The following three sources of liquidity risk are typically represented in a broad bid-ask spread and significant price fluctuations:
          a.	Bid-ask spread: how much a trader can lose by selling an asset and buying it back right away.
          b.	Market depth: how many units traders can sell or buy at the current bid or ask price without moving the price.
          c.	Market resiliency: how long it takes for prices that are temporarily incorrect to return to normal.
        </p>

      <div className="heading">
        <h4>
          Market Volatility
        </h4>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div className="text">
        <p>
          The prices of our products may change fast due to changes in the financial markets. Spreads alter in the same way that exchange rates do. During market events like economic and political news announcements, elections, and so forth, you will see more volatile price periods. Spreads might occasionally become much wider than typical at this time. The following effects may occur to your account as a result: Wide spreads often increase the cost of closing a trade. This will result in a decrease in your equity and increase the likelihood that you will fail to meet your margin requirement.

        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          You will see that your profit and loss will swing greatly when there is severe volatility. This greatly increases the likelihood that your account will experience negative equity and allows you to enter margin close out sooner. A highly leveraged trading account might suffer substantial losses in the event of a market surge, crash, or gap.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          The possibility of gapping is brought on by market turbulence. Gapping happens when our product prices abruptly change from one price to another as a result of market instability.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          There might not always be a window of opportunity between the two pricing levels for you to make an order or for the platform to carry one out. This may have the undesirable consequence of executing stop-loss orders at prices that were higher or lower than you had anticipated, depending on the direction of your transactions.

          There will be restrictions on when you may trade, such as being unable to do so on weekends and bank holidays (our website lists market opening and closing dates). Financial markets are typically closed to trading on certain days. You should be aware that this might result in the markets opening at a price that is very different from where they closed.

        <p>

          Over the weekend, on market holidays, and at other times when the relevant markets are often closed, you won't be able to make or modify orders. There is a strong chance that non-guaranteed "stop-loss" orders that were left in place to protect open positions maintained during these times may be filled at prices that are much below the price they were set at, and you will be responsible for "making good" on any losses, even if they were unanticipated.
