      <div className="text">
        <p>We provide services for trading derivative financial contracts. Our contracts are traded on a margin or leveraged basis, a type of trading which carries a high degree of risk to your capital. The price of the contract you make with us may change quickly and your profits and losses may be more than the amount of your investment or funds. If you do not have sufficient funds to meet your margin requirements, then we may close your open positions immediately and without notice. Please read the Risk Warning Notice carefully to understand the risks of trading on a margin or leverage basis. You should not deal in our contracts unless you understand and accept the risks of margin trading. Trading in these products may not be suitable for everyone.</p>

      <br />

This is without prejudice to any rights you may have to request copies of the information or, by notifying us in writing, to receive such information in hard copy, rather than by email or other electronic means. We reserve the right to charge for information and/or documents sent to you in a paper form.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          2.3	Unless we notify you otherwise, we will classify you as a Retail Client for the purpose of LFSA Rules. You have a right to request a different categorization but if we agree to this request, you will lose the protection of certain LFSA Rules.

        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          2.4	We will deal with you as principal and not as agent on your behalf. This means that any Trades are agreed directly between you and us and we will be the counterparty to all of your Trades.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          2.5	Unless we agree otherwise in writing, you will also deal with us as principal and not as an agent or representative of another person. You will not permit any person to deal on your behalf unless we agree that such person (the “Agent”) can act on your behalf. We will be entitled to rely on any instructions given to us by the Agent in relation to your Account. We may require confirmation that the Agent has authority to act on your behalf at any time we reasonably consider appropriate
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          2.6	In order to ensure that we can deal with you and discharge our obligations under applicable laws and regulations, you will provide us, as appropriate, with your legal entity identifier (“LEI”) (provided you are eligible for one) or such other information relating to, for example, your nationality as we will require to determine your national client identifier.

Accordingly, you should not regard any proposed trades, suggested trading strategies or other written or oral communications from us as investment recommendations or advice or as expressing our view as to whether a particular trade is suitable for you or meets your financial objectives. You must rely on your own judgement for any investment decision you make in relation to your Account. If you require investment or tax advice, please contact an independent investment or tax adviser.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          2.8	You will not have any rights of ownership, delivery or otherwise in any Underlying Instrument as a result of a Trade with us. We will not transfer any Underlying Instrument or any rights (such as voting rights or delivery obligations) in it to you.

Depending on your knowledge, experience and types of Trades, certain Account types and features may or may not be available to you. When we open an Account for you, we will inform you of the type of Account opened. We reserve the right to refuse to open an Account for any reason.

This means that a separate Cash balance, Net Equity, Trading Resource, Total Margin and Margin Close-out Level will apply for each Account, and following an Event of Default, CIL Trigger Event or Clearing House Default, the Trades and Open Positions in respect of each Account will be dealt with separately from the Trades and Open Positions in respect of each other Account.

Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to applicable laws, if you have more than one Account, we shall be entitled in our discretion (but shall not be obliged) without notice to set off any available Cash balance, Net Equity, Trading Resource or other funds in one of your Accounts against any of your liability to us (including discharging Margin requirements or liabilities in one or more of your other Accounts) even if the exercise of such set off may result in the closure of open positions in any Account from which funds are transferred.</p>
        <br />
        <p>3.2	Limited Risk Accounts, if and when offered, can only be operated if a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order is specified with each opening Trade placed (see clause 8). Additional information with respect to details of Accounts available will be set out on our website.</p>

        <p>3.3	We are obliged by FSA Rules to obtain information about your relevant investment knowledge and experience so that we can assess whether a service or Product is appropriate for you; and if it is not to give you a suitable warning. If you choose not to provide us with the information we request or if you provide insufficient information, we will not be able to determine whether the service or Product is appropriate for you. In these circumstances we shall give you a suitable warning and we may not be able to open an Account for you. Please note that we are not obliged to assess or ensure the suitability of any Trade you place.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>3.4	We are also required to obtain certain information about your other investment activities in order to ascertain your status for the purposes of regulations which apply to trading in over-the-counter derivatives.</p>
        <br />
        <p>3.5	You undertake that any information you provide to us is correct.

        <p>3.6	For each Account that we open for you, we will provide you with a unique Account number and/or username, as applicable, and will require such other Security Information as we consider appropriate:

            <li>3.6.4	when you deal with us or give us an instruction, we will require details of your Security Information, including your Account number (or in the event your Agent deals with us, your Agent’s Account number) and/or username as applicable.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>3.7 Except where otherwise provided in this clause 3.7, you are responsible for paying any Losses, fees or charges arising from Trades entered into or instructions given using your Account number and/or username, as applicable, and Security Information. You will not be responsible for Losses where it can be shown that such Losses result from a person gaining access to our Trading Platform by abuse of our systems (that is by “hacking”) except where such access results from your failure to comply with clauses 3.6 or 26.5. If you fail to comply with these clauses, then you will be liable for the resulting loss.</p>
        <br />
        <p>

            <p>3.8.3	All Joint Account Holders shall be jointly and severally liable for Losses, fees or charges arising on a joint Account. Among other things, this means that any monies owed on the relevant Account shall be payable in full by you or any of the other Joint Account Holders; and</p>
            <p>3.8.4	If you or any other Joint Account Holder dies, we may take instructions from and pay any balance to the survivor(s).</p>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>3.9 To the extent permitted under applicable laws and regulations, we may inform you that your Accounts will be Linked Accounts. Your Linked Accounts may be aggregated for the purpose of calculating your Margin Level, your Total Margin or otherwise as specified in this Agreement. It is not possible for a General Account and an ISCA Account to be Linked Accounts in respect of each other.</p>
        <br />
        <p>3.10 Your Account will be denominated in a Base Currency. Your Base Currency can be found on the Trading Platform. We will only accept funds in your Base Currency. Trades for certain Markets may be conducted in other currencies however the resulting Open Positions may be valued at or converted to the Base Currency in accordance with clause 18 or the relevant Supplemental Terms.</p>

            <li>4.1.2 when we receive your Order, we will provide you with an electronic acknowledgement of receipt, but you and we will be bound by a Trade only when details of the Trade are reported as executed on the Trading Platform.

        <br />
        <p>4.2 We may accept Orders by telephone. In the event you place an Order by telephone:
          <ul>
            <li>

              4.2.1 your oral instruction to Trade will constitute an offer to enter into a Trade at the price we quote. Trades placed by telephone will only be accepted at the current Our Price.
            </li>
            <li>

              4.2.2 you can place an Order by telephone only by talking directly to an authorized person. We will not accept an Order left with other employees, on an answering machine or on a voice mail facility.

Market Hours are as stated in the Market Information and may change from time to time.</p>
        <br />
        <p>4.4 Prices quoted by us (whether by telephone, the Trading Platform or otherwise) do not constitute a contractual offer to enter into a Trade at the price quotes or at all. We reserve the right to refuse to enter into any Trade. Such situations include but are not limited to one or more of the following:
          <ul>
            <li>

              4.4.1 Trades are placed outside of the Market Hours (clause 4.3).
            </li>
            <li>

              4.4.2 Trades are individually or in the aggregate larger than the maximum Quantity or smaller than the minimum Quantity we set for the Market (clause 4.6).
            </li>
            <li>

              4.4.3 Our Price has moved unfavorably in excess of the specified Price Tolerance (if applicable to your Account) (clause 5.6).

            </li>
            <li>

              4.4.5 entry into the Trade would cause you to exceed the maximum Total Margin, if any, applied to your Account (clause 10).
            </li>
            <li>

              4.4.6 Our Price or the Trade derives from a Manifest Error (clause 14).

            <li>

              4.4.9 we believe the Trade would be in breach of this Agreement or any legal or regulatory               r               requirement applicable to you or us.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          4.5 If we accept a Trade before becoming aware of any of the events described in clauses 4.4.1 to 4.4.9, we may in our sole discretion treat the Trade as void or close the Open Position at Our Price prevailing at the time we close the Open Position. If we choose to maintain the Open Position, you will be liable for the full value of the Trade when it is closed.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          4.6 We may set minimum and maximum Quantities for opening and/or closing Trades in each Market and different minimum and maximum Quantities for Trades placed on the Trading Platform or by telephone. Minimum and maximum Quantities (if any) are stated in the Market Information. Trades to close an Open Position are subject to the minimum and maximum Quantity valid at the time that the closing Trade is executed. We may be unable to execute Trades at Our Price which are larger than our maximum Quantity or smaller than our minimum Quantity. Where you wish to execute a Trade whose size exceeds our maximum Quantity, you may request a quote. Where a Trade is executed through several transactions at varying prices you will be charged separate fees and commission for each individual transaction. If multiple Trade instructions are placed or triggered, which in aggregate exceed our maximum Quantity for the relevant Market, we may in our sole discretion take any of the following action: (a) refuse to enter into all or some of the Trades; (b) partially fill your Trades and/or (c) increase the margin rate charged on the positions you hold in the relevant Market. We may vary the minimum and maximum Quantity from time to time and new minimum and maximum Quantities will be effective at the time of publication.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          4.8 Where your Open Position is larger than our maximum Quantity and you have not closed it before its expiry date, we may roll over the Open Position rather than settle it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          4.7 Subject to our right to refuse to enter into any Trade pursuant to clause 4.4, we will use our reasonable endeavors to execute a Trade within a reasonable time after we receive it or after the conditions for an Order are fulfilled.

        <p>

          4.17 Without limiting clause 4.16, but without double-counting the effect of any limitation imposed by that clause, if, in respect of any Centrally Cleared Trade, the relevant Clearing House fails to make any CCP Settlement Payment to us or to return any collateral or margin posted or transferred by us to the relevant Clearing House in respect of the related CCP Transaction, an amount equal to such amount shall be due from you to us and, for the avoidance of doubt, clause 27.12 shall apply to such amount. If, following the payment of any such amount by you to us we subsequently receive or recover the relevant amount from the relevant Clearing House, we shall reimburse you for that amount, together with any interest thereon which we received or recovered from the Clearing House.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>

          4.18 We will give you notice in writing of any deduction, withholding or other reduction from any payment or performance effected under clause 4.16 or any amount payable by you or reimbursable by us pursuant to clause 4.17, in each case as soon as reasonably practicable following the relevant event.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>

          4.19 To the extent of any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement in respect of a Centrally Cleared Trade and any Mandatory CCP Provision, such Mandatory CCP Provision will prevail in respect of such Centrally Cleared Transaction. You agree to be bound by and to comply with the Mandatory CCP Provisions of each relevant Clearing House Service.
