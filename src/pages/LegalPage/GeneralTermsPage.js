      <div className="text">
        <p>We provide services for trading derivative financial contracts. Our contracts are traded on a margin or leveraged basis, a type of trading which carries a high degree of risk to your capital. The price of the contract you make with us may change quickly and your profits and losses may be more than the amount of your investment or funds. If you do not have sufficient funds to meet your margin requirements, then we may close your open positions immediately and without notice. Please read the Risk Warning Notice carefully to understand the risks of trading on a margin or leverage basis. You should not deal in our contracts unless you understand and accept the risks of margin trading. Trading in these products may not be suitable for everyone.</p>

      <br />

This is without prejudice to any rights you may have to request copies of the information or, by notifying us in writing, to receive such information in hard copy, rather than by email or other electronic means. We reserve the right to charge for information and/or documents sent to you in a paper form.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          2.3	Unless we notify you otherwise, we will classify you as a Retail Client for the purpose of LFSA Rules. You have a right to request a different categorization but if we agree to this request, you will lose the protection of certain LFSA Rules.

        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          2.4	We will deal with you as principal and not as agent on your behalf. This means that any Trades are agreed directly between you and us and we will be the counterparty to all of your Trades.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          2.5	Unless we agree otherwise in writing, you will also deal with us as principal and not as an agent or representative of another person. You will not permit any person to deal on your behalf unless we agree that such person (the “Agent”) can act on your behalf. We will be entitled to rely on any instructions given to us by the Agent in relation to your Account. We may require confirmation that the Agent has authority to act on your behalf at any time we reasonably consider appropriate
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          2.6	In order to ensure that we can deal with you and discharge our obligations under applicable laws and regulations, you will provide us, as appropriate, with your legal entity identifier (“LEI”) (provided you are eligible for one) or such other information relating to, for example, your nationality as we will require to determine your national client identifier.

Accordingly, you should not regard any proposed trades, suggested trading strategies or other written or oral communications from us as investment recommendations or advice or as expressing our view as to whether a particular trade is suitable for you or meets your financial objectives. You must rely on your own judgement for any investment decision you make in relation to your Account. If you require investment or tax advice, please contact an independent investment or tax adviser.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          2.8	You will not have any rights of ownership, delivery or otherwise in any Underlying Instrument as a result of a Trade with us. We will not transfer any Underlying Instrument or any rights (such as voting rights or delivery obligations) in it to you.

Depending on your knowledge, experience and types of Trades, certain Account types and features may or may not be available to you. When we open an Account for you, we will inform you of the type of Account opened. We reserve the right to refuse to open an Account for any reason. Furthermore, we may change the features and criteria of our Accounts at any time by notifying you of the change whether on our Website, Trading Platform, via email or otherwise.

This means that a separate Cash balance, Net Equity, Trading Resource, Total Margin and Margin Close-out Level will apply for each Account, and following an Event of Default, CIL Trigger Event or Clearing House Default, the Trades and Open Positions in respect of each Account will be dealt with separately from the Trades and Open Positions in respect of each other Account.

Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to applicable laws, if you have more than one Account, we shall be entitled in our discretion (but shall not be obliged) without notice to set off any available Cash balance, Net Equity, Trading Resource or other funds in one of your Accounts against any of your liability to us (including discharging Margin requirements or liabilities in one or more of your other Accounts) even if the exercise of such set off may result in the closure of open positions in any Account from which funds are transferred.</p>
        <br />
        <p>3.2	Limited Risk Accounts, if and when offered, can only be operated if a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order is specified with each opening Trade placed (see clause 8). Additional information with respect to details of Accounts available will be set out on our website.</p>

        <p>3.3	We are obliged by FSA Rules to obtain information about your relevant investment knowledge and experience so that we can assess whether a service or Product is appropriate for you; and if it is not to give you a suitable warning. If you choose not to provide us with the information we request or if you provide insufficient information, we will not be able to determine whether the service or Product is appropriate for you. In these circumstances we shall give you a suitable warning and we may not be able to open an Account for you. Please note that we are not obliged to assess or ensure the suitability of any Trade you place.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>3.4	We are also required to obtain certain information about your other investment activities in order to ascertain your status for the purposes of regulations which apply to trading in over-the-counter derivatives.</p>
        <br />
        <p>3.5	You undertake that any information you provide to us is correct.

        <p>3.6	For each Account that we open for you, we will provide you with a unique Account number and/or username, as applicable, and will require such other Security Information as we consider appropriate:

            <li>3.6.4	when you deal with us or give us an instruction, we will require details of your Security Information, including your Account number (or in the event your Agent deals with us, your Agent’s Account number) and/or username as applicable.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>3.7 Except where otherwise provided in this clause 3.7, you are responsible for paying any Losses, fees or charges arising from Trades entered into or instructions given using your Account number and/or username, as applicable, and Security Information. You will not be responsible for Losses where it can be shown that such Losses result from a person gaining access to our Trading Platform by abuse of our systems (that is by “hacking”) except where such access results from your failure to comply with clauses 3.6 or 26.5. If you fail to comply with these clauses, then you will be liable for the resulting loss.</p>
        <br />
        <p>

            <p>3.8.3	All Joint Account Holders shall be jointly and severally liable for Losses, fees or charges arising on a joint Account. Among other things, this means that any monies owed on the relevant Account shall be payable in full by you or any of the other Joint Account Holders; and</p>
            <p>3.8.4	If you or any other Joint Account Holder dies, we may take instructions from and pay any balance to the survivor(s).</p>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>3.9 To the extent permitted under applicable laws and regulations, we may inform you that your Accounts will be Linked Accounts. Your Linked Accounts may be aggregated for the purpose of calculating your Margin Level, your Total Margin or otherwise as specified in this Agreement. It is not possible for a General Account and an ISCA Account to be Linked Accounts in respect of each other.</p>
        <br />
        <p>3.10 Your Account will be denominated in a Base Currency. Your Base Currency can be found on the Trading Platform. We will only accept funds in your Base Currency. Trades for certain Markets may be conducted in other currencies however the resulting Open Positions may be valued at or converted to the Base Currency in accordance with clause 18 or the relevant Supplemental Terms.</p>

            <li>4.1.2 when we receive your Order, we will provide you with an electronic acknowledgement of receipt, but you and we will be bound by a Trade only when details of the Trade are reported as executed on the Trading Platform.

        <br />
        <p>4.2 We may accept Orders by telephone. In the event you place an Order by telephone:
          <ul>
            <li>

              4.2.1 your oral instruction to Trade will constitute an offer to enter into a Trade at the price we quote. Trades placed by telephone will only be accepted at the current Our Price.
            </li>
            <li>

              4.2.2 you can place an Order by telephone only by talking directly to an authorized person. We will not accept an Order left with other employees, on an answering machine or on a voice mail facility.

Market Hours are as stated in the Market Information and may change from time to time.</p>
        <br />
        <p>4.4 Prices quoted by us (whether by telephone, the Trading Platform or otherwise) do not constitute a contractual offer to enter into a Trade at the price quotes or at all. We reserve the right to refuse to enter into any Trade. Such situations include but are not limited to one or more of the following:
          <ul>
            <li>

              4.4.1 Trades are placed outside of the Market Hours (clause 4.3).
            </li>
            <li>

              4.4.2 Trades are individually or in the aggregate larger than the maximum Quantity or smaller than the minimum Quantity we set for the Market (clause 4.6).
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>

              4.4.5 entry into the Trade would cause you to exceed the maximum Total Margin, if any, applied to your Account (clause 10).
            </li>
            <li>

              4.4.6 Our Price or the Trade derives from a Manifest Error (clause 14).

            <li>

              4.4.9 we believe the Trade would be in breach of this Agreement or any legal or regulatory               r               requirement applicable to you or us.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          4.5 If we accept a Trade before becoming aware of any of the events described in clauses 4.4.1 to 4.4.9, we may in our sole discretion treat the Trade as void or close the Open Position at Our Price prevailing at the time we close the Open Position. If we choose to maintain the Open Position, you will be liable for the full value of the Trade when it is closed.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          4.6 We may set minimum and maximum Quantities for opening and/or closing Trades in each Market and different minimum and maximum Quantities for Trades placed on the Trading Platform or by telephone. Minimum and maximum Quantities (if any) are stated in the Market Information. Trades to close an Open Position are subject to the minimum and maximum Quantity valid at the time that the closing Trade is executed. We may be unable to execute Trades at Our Price which are larger than our maximum Quantity or smaller than our minimum Quantity. Where you wish to execute a Trade whose size exceeds our maximum Quantity, you may request a quote. Where a Trade is executed through several transactions at varying prices you will be charged separate fees and commission for each individual transaction. If multiple Trade instructions are placed or triggered, which in aggregate exceed our maximum Quantity for the relevant Market, we may in our sole discretion take any of the following action: (a) refuse to enter into all or some of the Trades; (b) partially fill your Trades and/or (c) increase the margin rate charged on the positions you hold in the relevant Market. We may vary the minimum and maximum Quantity from time to time and new minimum and maximum Quantities will be effective at the time of publication.

        <br />
        <p>

          4.8 Where your Open Position is larger than our maximum Quantity and you have not closed it before its expiry date, we may roll over the Open Position rather than settle it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          4.7 Subject to our right to refuse to enter into any Trade pursuant to clause 4.4, we will use our reasonable endeavors to execute a Trade within a reasonable time after we receive it or after the conditions for an Order are fulfilled.

          4.17 Without limiting clause 4.16, but without double-counting the effect of any limitation imposed by that clause, if, in respect of any Centrally Cleared Trade, the relevant Clearing House fails to make any CCP Settlement Payment to us or to return any collateral or margin posted or transferred by us to the relevant Clearing House in respect of the related CCP Transaction, an amount equal to such amount shall be due from you to us and, for the avoidance of doubt, clause 27.12 shall apply to such amount. If, following the payment of any such amount by you to us we subsequently receive or recover the relevant amount from the relevant Clearing House, we shall reimburse you for that amount, together with any interest thereon which we received or recovered from the Clearing House.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>

          4.18 We will give you notice in writing of any deduction, withholding or other reduction from any payment or performance effected under clause 4.16 or any amount payable by you or reimbursable by us pursuant to clause 4.17, in each case as soon as reasonably practicable following the relevant event.

        <p>

          4.19 To the extent of any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement in respect of a Centrally Cleared Trade and any Mandatory CCP Provision, such Mandatory CCP Provision will prevail in respect of such Centrally Cleared Transaction. You agree to be bound by and to comply with the Mandatory CCP Provisions of each relevant Clearing House Service.

        <h5>5. Our Price</h5>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div className="text">
        <p>5.1 During Market Hours, we will quote two prices for the Market: a higher price (“Our Offer Price”) and a lower price (“Our Bid Price”); together these prices are known as “Our Price” for a Market. Our Price is determined by reference to the price of the Underlying Instrument which is quoted on external securities exchanges or dealing facilities that we select at our discretion in line with our regulatory obligations. For Trades executed when the relevant exchange or dealing facility is closed or where there is no exchange or dealing facility, Our Price will reflect what we consider the market price of the Underlying Instrument is at that time. Subject to our regulatory obligation to provide best execution, Our Prices and how we calculate Our Prices are determined in our absolute discretion and any changes are effective immediately. If during Market Hours Our Price for any Market is not available on the Trading Platform, please call Client Management to obtain a quote.</p>
        <br />
        <p>5.2 We will accept a Trade only on the basis of a current Our Price. You may not be able to enter into Trades at Our Price where Our Price is described as “indication only” or “indicative” or “invalid” (or words or messages to the same effect).</p>
        <br />
        <p>5.3 We provide quotes for Our Prices on a best-efforts basis. If a Market Disruption Event or an Event Outside of Our Control occurs, we may not be able to provide a quote for Our Price or execute Trades during Market Hours.</p>
        <br />
        <p>5.4 The difference between Our Bid Price and Our Offer Price is “Our Spread”. For certain Products, Our Spread may contain an element of charge or commission for us. For some Markets Our Spreads change frequently and there is no limit to how large any such changes may be. You acknowledge that when you close a Trade, Our Spread may be larger or smaller than Our Spread when the Trade was opened, even for markets where Our Spread is fixed.</p>
        <br />
        <p>5.5 Unless otherwise stated in the relevant Supplemental Terms, we will provide you with best execution as defined by the LFSA Rules. Please read our Trade and Order Execution Policy which sets out the basis upon which we seek to provide best execution.</p>
        <br />
        <p>5.6 If your Account has Price Tolerance, Markets where Price Tolerance applies will be set out in the Market Information. Price Tolerance will only apply to instructions to Trade for immediate execution. Where applicable, you may change the Price Tolerance via the Trading Platform before you place a Trade. If, before we have executed your Trade, Our Price moves unfavorably away from our quoted price but remains within the specified Price Tolerance, your Trade will be executed at the current Our Price. If, before we have executed your Trade, Our Price moves in your favor (irrespective of the specified Price Tolerance), we will execute the Trade at the current Our Price.</p>

      </div>
      <br />
      <div className="text">
        <p>6.1 If you have an Account with hedging enabled, you can close an open Trade by selecting that specific trade and closing it. If you open an opposing Trade in the same market for the same quantity, both the original Trade and the opposing Trade will be displayed as open, and you will also see the legally binding net position where those Trades offset each other.</p>
        <br />
        <p>6.2 If you have an Account without hedging enabled, you can close an open Trade either by selecting that Trade and closing it, or by opening a Trade in the opposing direction.</p>
        <br />
        <p>6.3 For some Accounts, if you enter into a closing Trade in the same Market with a greater Quantity but in the same expiry as the Open Position it offsets, then the original Open Position will be closed and a new Open Position will be created for the Quantity by which the new Trade exceeds the original Open Position.</p>
        <br />
        <p>6.4 You will usually be able to close an Open Position during Market Hours. However, we reserve the right to reject any Trade in accordance with clause 4.4. As a consequence, you may not be able to close the Open Position and your Losses may be unlimited until such time as you are able to close the Open Position. Where you inadvertently close an Open Position and promptly notify us of this error, at your request we may (in certain, exceptional circumstances, acting at our sole discretion and as a gesture of goodwill) allow you to take a new Open Position equivalent to the terms of the original Open Position duly closed by you in error, with such new Open Position being reported to the applicable regulatory authorities as such in the normal course of business.</p>
        <br />
        <p>6.5 Unless Open Positions are closed in accordance with this clause 6, rolled over in accordance with clause 7, or are terminated, voided, or otherwise closed in accordance with this Agreement, they will remain open until their expiry (if they have an expiry date or event) or will remain open indefinitely if they do not. On the expiry date (or event, if such expiration is dependent upon an event) the Open Position will be closed and settled at Our Price at the time the Open Position is closed.</p>
        <br />
        <p>6.6 Where we exercise our rights in accordance with this Agreement to close any of your Open Positions, we will, subject to any obligations that we may have under applicable laws and regulations, do so at a time and date determined by us in our reasonable discretion.</p>

        <p>7.1 We may allow Open Positions to be rolled in accordance with your instructions.</p>
        <br />
        <p>7.2 If we agree to roll over an Open Position, then the original Open Position is closed and becomes due for settlement at Our Price at the time the Open Position is closed, and a new Trade will be entered into to establish a new Open Position in the relevant Market. The times at which we will close Open Positions which are rolled over are stated in the Market Information.

          8.1 The range of different Order types which we accept shall be decided by us in our absolute discretion. Certain types of Orders, such as Guaranteed Stop Loss Orders, may only be available for a limited range of Markets.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>

          8.2 The types of Orders we accept, and which types of Orders attach to specific Open Positions or other Orders (“Attached Orders”) are detailed on our Trading Platform. We may at our discretion limit the Quantity of any Trade and Orders we accept without notice. It is your responsibility to understand the features of an Order and how the Order will operate before you place it. Before you place an Order for the first time, we recommend that you read the trading examples on our website so that you fully understand the features of the Order type.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>

          8.3 We endeavor to fill Orders at the first Our Price reasonably available to us after the price specified is reached or at the occurrence of the event or condition specified in the Order. However, we may not be able to execute Orders if there is an Event Outside of Our Control in relation to an Underlying Instrument. For all Orders other than Guaranteed Stop Loss Orders, we may not be able to execute your Order at the price level you specify. We will endeavor to execute your Order at Our Price nearest to your specified price.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>

          8.4 We may, without limitation, set a minimum price range between the current Our Price and the price or level of any Stop Orders, Guaranteed Stop Loss Orders and Limit Orders and we reserve the right not to accept any Orders which are less than this minimum price range.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>

          8.5 Orders will be “Good until Cancelled” (“GTC”) unless you specify at the time of placing the relevant Order that it is only “Good for the Day” (“GFD”) or “Good for the Time” (“GFT”). Unless an Order is cancelled or ceases to have effect, we will regard it as valid and execute it when Our Price reaches the price you specify, or the specified event or condition occurs.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>

          8.6 Subject to clause 8.7 below, you can only cancel or amend an Order if we have not acted upon it. You may, with our consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld), cancel or amend an Order at any time before we act upon it. Changes to Orders may be made on the Trading Platform or by calling Client Management.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>

          8.7 If you have a Limited Risk Account, a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order cannot be cancelled by you at any time. It will only be cancelled if you close the corresponding Open Position. You may, however, amend a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order in accordance with clause 8.6 above.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>

          8.8 When you place an Order to close an Open Position (a “Closing Order”):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>

            8.8.1 if you close the Open Position before the Closing Order is executed, we will treat this as an instruction to cancel the Closing Order; and
          </li>
          <li>

            8.8.2 if you close only a portion of the Open Position before the Closing Order is executed, we will treat the Order as an Order to close only the portion of the Open Position that remains open.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <p>

          8.9 We offer Guaranteed Stop Loss Orders for a limited range of Markets. For these Markets:
          8.9.1 the Market Information states if a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order is available.
          8.9.2 we may charge a premium payment for each Guaranteed Stop Loss Order. The rate or price of this payment is stated in the Market Information.
          8.9.3 we will accept your Guaranteed Stop Loss Order only during Market Hours.
          8.9.4 we will execute a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order at the price you specify, when that price level is reached; and
          8.9.5 we may make available and set minimum and maximum Quantities for Guaranteed Stop Loss Orders which are different from the minimum and maximum Quantities which apply to other types of Order.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h5>10. Margin Requirement</h5>
      </div>
      <br />

      <div className="text">
        <p>
          10.1 Before you place a Trade which creates an Open Position you must ensure that your Trading Resource is sufficient to cover the Margin Requirement in respect of that Open Position. If your Trading Resource is less than the Margin Requirement for the Open Position you wish to create, we may (and will, where and to the extent this is required by applicable laws and regulations) reject your Trade. The Margin Requirement must be maintained at all times until the Open Position is closed and may increase or decrease at any time until the Open Position is closed.

        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          10.2 The applicable Margin Requirement for an Open Position may vary depending on the Underlying Instrument and your client categorization and whether your Open Position is an Established Position. You will find details of the applicable Margin Requirements on our Website or Trading Platform.

        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          10.3 The Margin Requirement for an Open Position is calculated using the Margin Factor for the relevant Market. Margin Factors may be expressed as a percentage, number, or other form applicable to the nature of the Market. The Margin Requirement may increase or decrease at any time until the Open Position is closed.

        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          10.4 Margin Factors for each Market are stated in the Market Information. Unless otherwise stated in our Notices and Policies with respect to third party trading platforms, Margin Factors change as set forth in this clause 10.3. Changes to a Margin Factor will increase or decrease your Margin Requirement. For Margin Factors expressed as a percentage and all Open Positions subject to Orders Aware Margining, the Margin Requirement may change as Our Price for the relevant Market changes. Margin Requirement may also be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the Base Currency and the currency of any Open Position.

        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          10.5 Non-standard Margin Requirements may apply for the following:

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            10.5.1 for certain Markets derived from options or options-related financial instruments.

          </li>

          <li>
            10.5.2 when you are holding positions in two or more Markets in the same Underlying Instrument.

          </li>

          <li>
            10.5.3 Trades which have an attached Stop Loss Order in Markets where Orders Aware Margining is available (clause 10.7).

          </li>

          <li>
            10.5.4 when a Margin Multiplier is applied (clause 10.8); and

          </li>

          <li>
            10.5.5 when the Quantity of a Trade is greater than our maximum Quantity (clause 4.6)

          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Details of how we calculate non-standard Margin Requirements are set out on our website.

        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          10.6 We reserve the right to change the way in which we calculate Margin Requirements at any time.

        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          10.7 Orders Aware Margining offers the potential to reduce the Margin Requirement for Open Positions in certain Markets which are booked to a General Account, and which are subject to a Stop Loss Order or a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order. Orders Aware Margining is available for a limited range of Markets and details of its availability is provided in the Market Information. Orders Aware Margining is not available for Open Positions which are booked to an ISCA Account.

          10.8 We may apply a Margin Multiplier to all Open Positions placed in your Account or to a specific Open Position. The application of a Margin Multiplier or any change in a Margin Multiplier will result in a change to the Margin Requirement for any Open Positions for the relevant Markets. The Margin Multiplier for Trades booked to an ISCA Account may be greater than the Margin Multiplier for Trades booked to a General Account.

        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          10.9 We may alter Margin Factors, Margin Multipliers and Margin Requirements at any time and any change may become effective immediately. For Open Positions which are booked to a General Account, subject to our rights in clauses 15 and 16, we will provide you with at least 24 hours’ notice of any increase in Margin Factors, Margin Multipliers or Margin Requirement. For Open Positions which are booked to an ISCA Account, any increase in Margin Factors, Margin Multipliers or Margin Requirement may take effect immediately upon our notifying you of those changes. It is your responsibility to know at all times the current Margin Factors, Margin Multiplier and Margin Requirement applicable to your Account and your Open Positions.

        </p>

        <p>
          10.10 We may notify you of an alteration to the Margin Factors, Margin Multiplier and Margin Requirement by any of the following means: post, telephone, fax, email, text message or by posting notice of the increase on our website or Trading Platform.

        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          10.11 Your Total Margin will be the aggregate of all Margin Requirements in your Account. We may set a maximum figure for your Total Margin which will act as a limit on the amount of funds we hold as the Margin Requirement. If we set a maximum Total Margin, we will inform you.

        <p>
          11.1 If the Margin Level for your Account reaches or falls below the Margin Close Out Level, this will be classified as an Event of Default under clause 16. In such circumstances we may (and will, where and to the extent this is required by applicable laws and regulations) close all or any of your Open Positions immediately with or without notice. In addition, we may, among other things, refuse to execute new Trades until your Margin Level exceeds the Margin Close Out Level. It is your responsibility to monitor your Account(s) at all times and to maintain your Margin Level above the Margin Close Out Level. We will close your Open Positions at Our Price prevailing at the time when your Open Positions are closed.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          11.2 We may but are not obliged to contact you before we take any action under clause 11.1.

        <br />
        <p>
          11.3 You will be notified of the Margin Close Out Level applicable to your Account on our Website or Trading Platform. We may alter the Margin Close Out Level applicable to your Account at any time, including where this is required to comply with applicable laws and regulations. For a General Account, subject to our rights in clauses 15 and 16, we will provide you with at least three (3) days’ notice of any change to your Margin Close Out Level, unless we are unable to do so in order to effect an immediate change in the Margin Close Out Level required under applicable laws and regulations. For an ISCA Account, any change to your Margin Close Out Level may take effect immediately upon our notifying you of that change. It is your responsibility to remain informed about the Margin Close Out Level applicable to your Account.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          11.4 We will be entitled to notify you of an alteration to your Margin Close Out Level by any of the following means: post, telephone, fax, email, text message or by posting notice of the increase on our website or Trading Platform.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          11.5 The Margin Close Out Level is designed to help limit the extent of your trading Losses. There might be circumstances (e.g. suspended markets) in which we will be unable to close out Open Positions and we do not guarantee that your Open Positions will be closed when the Margin Level for your Account reaches the Margin Close Out Level or, save to the extent required by applicable laws and regulations, that your Losses will be limited to the amount of funds you have transferred into your Account. In such circumstances we will monitor your Open Positions and take such other actions as we consider to be reasonable.

          13.1 If your Account shows a positive Cash balance, you may request that we make a payment to you of such amount. We may however elect to withhold any payment requested, in whole or in part, if:

        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          13.2 Subject to clause 13.3, we may debit the Cash balance on your Account with any amount due and payable to us under this Agreement, and with any bank transfer charges we incur in transferring funds to you. In addition, you are responsible for all costs and expenses we incur as a result of you failing to pay amounts due or if you breach the Agreement including, without limitation, bank charges, court fees, legal fees, and other third-party costs we reasonably incur.

        <p>
          13.3 If your Account shows a negative Cash balance, and notwithstanding any other right that we may have under this Agreement or applicable laws and regulations, we may (and will, where and to the extent this is required by applicable laws and regulations) waive our right to claim payment of any amount due and payable to us under this Agreement and return the Cash balance to zero.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          13.4 If we credit a payment to your Account but subsequently discover that the credit was made in error, we reserve the right to reverse any such credit and/or cancel any Trades which could not have been made or close any Open Position which could not have been established but for that credit.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          13.5 Unless we agree otherwise, any amounts payable to you will be paid by direct transfer to the same source (in your name) from which you have made payment to us.

        <br />
        <p>
          13.6 Payment of any amount due to us is subject to the following conditions:

          <li>13.6.3 unless otherwise agreed your Account will be credited with the net cleared funds received after all deductions of bank charges or any other costs of transfer incurred in relation to the payment.</li>
          <li>13.6.4 if made by cheque or bank transfer, the cheque must be drawn on or the transfer made must be made from an account in your name with a credit institution or other bank we deem satisfactory. We will regard as an acceptable credit institution any bank incorporated and duly licensed in the United Kingdom or a state which is a member of the European Union, or any branch of a bank located and duly licensed in the United Kingdom or a state which is a member of the European Union.</li>
          <li>13.6.5 if you wish to make a payment through a non-United Kingdom or non-European Union bank (or card issued by such a bank) please contact us to confirm the acceptability of the bank concerned before a payment is required to be made; and</li>
          <li>13.6.6 we do not accept cash or payments from third parties unless otherwise agreed.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          13.7 If your Account is in debit, the full amount is due and payable by you immediately unless and to the extent we are not permitted to recover such sums from you by applicable laws and regulations.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          13.8 We may refuse to accept payment by cheque or banker’s draft and may require immediate payment by telegraphic transfer, debit card or any other method of electronic transfer acceptable to us.

        <p>
          13.9 If you fail to pay any sum due to us on the due date in accordance with this Agreement, we will charge interest on this amount. Interest will be due on a daily basis from the due date until the date on which payment is received in full at a rate not exceeding 4% above the applicable central bank’s official base rate for short-term funds (or a rate we reasonably consider serves materially the same function) from time to time and will be payable on demand.

          14.1 A Manifest Error is an error, omission or misquote (including any misquote by our dealer) which by fault of either of us or any third party is materially and clearly incorrect when considering market conditions and quotes in Markets or Underlying Instruments which prevailed at that time. It may include, but is not limited to, an incorrect price, date, time, Market or currency pair, financing calculation, rebate, commission or any error or lack of clarity of any information, source, commentator, official result, or pronouncement.

          14.3 We will exercise the rights in clause 14.2 as soon as reasonably practicable after we become aware of the Manifest Error. To the extent practicable we will give you prior notice of any action we take under this clause but if this is not practicable, we will give you notice as soon as practicable afterwards. If you consider that a Trade is based on a Manifest Error, then you must notify us immediately.

        <p>16.3 We may also close your Account on 14 days’ notice in the circumstances set out below. If we rely on our rights under this clause, your Account will be suspended during the 14-day notice period, and you will not be able to place Trades other than those to close existing Open Positions. If you have not closed all Open Positions within the period of 14 days’ notice, we shall be entitled to take any action within clause 16.2. The relevant circumstances are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>16.3.1 any litigation is commenced involving both of us in an adversarial position to each other and, in view of the subject matter of or any issues in dispute in relation to that litigation, we reasonably decide that we cannot continue to deal with you while the litigation is pending.</li>

        <br />
        <p>16.4 Without limiting our right to take any action under clauses 16.2 and 16.3, we may also close individual Open Positions and/or cancel any Orders where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>16.4.1 we are in dispute with you in respect of an Open Position. In this case we can close all or part of the Open Position in order to minimize the amount in dispute; and/or</li>
          <li>16.4.2 there is a material breach of the Agreement in relation to the Open Position.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>16.5 Without limiting our right to act under clauses 16.2, 16.3 and 16.4, we may in our discretion suspend your Account pending investigation for any reason. Whilst your Account is suspended you will be able to place Trades to close your Open Positions, but you will not be entitled to place Trades which would create new Open Positions. Circumstances in which we may choose to exercise this right include but are not limited to the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>16.5.1 when we have reason to believe that an Event of Default has occurred or may occur but believe that it is reasonably necessary to investigate circumstances with a view to confirming this.</li>
          <li>16.5.2 when we have reason to believe that you do not have a sufficient understanding of the Trades which you are placing, or the risks involved.</li>
          <li>16.5.3 when we have not received within 10 days of a written request all information, that we believe that we require in connection with this Agreement: and/or</li>
          <li>16.5.4 we have reason to believe that there has been a breach in your Account security or that there is a threat to your Account security.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>16.6 If we have suspended your Account pending investigation, we will use reasonable endeavors to conclude our investigation within five (5) Business Days. When we conclude our investigation, we will inform you whether trading on your Account may resume or whether we will seek to take further action pursuant to this Agreement.</p>
        <br />
        <p>16.7 If you fail to comply with your obligation to make a Cleared Account Election pursuant to clauses 4.9 or 4.14 or to take any action or close any Open Position under clauses 4.10, 4.11 or 4.14, we may close any affected Open Position.</p>
        <br />
        <p>16.8 We may exercise our rights to close Open Positions under this clause 16 at any time after the relevant event has occurred and will do so on the basis of the next available Our Price for the affected Open Positions.</p>

        <br />
        <p>17.4 You may request us to exercise the rights in clause 17.2 above in relation to all your accounts and/or Open Positions which have been closed but we may not be able to comply with such a request to the extent this is not permitted by applicable laws and regulations.</p>
        <br />
        <p>17.5 If the rights under clauses 17.2, 17.3 or 17.4 are exercised, all the payment obligations will be consolidated into an obligation for you to pay a net sum to us or for us to pay a net sum to you.</p>
        <br />
        <p>17.6 If a CIL Trigger Event or Clearing House Default occurs, the following provisions will apply in respect of each relevant Centrally Cleared Transaction Set:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>17.6.1 each Centrally Cleared Trade in the relevant Centrally Cleared Transaction Set will automatically terminate upon the occurrence of that CIL Trigger Event or Clearing House Default (as applicable) and, following such termination, no further payments or deliveries in respect of such Centrally Cleared Trade or any default interest, howsoever described, on such payment obligations will be required to be made but without prejudice to the other provisions of this Agreement, and the amount payable following such termination will be the Cleared Set Termination Amount determined pursuant to this clause 17.6;</li>
          <li>17.6.2 the value of each such terminated Centrally Cleared Trade for the purposes of calculating the Cleared Set Termination Amount and Aggregate Transaction Values will be equal to the relevant CCP Transaction Value or the relevant part thereof.</li>
          <li>17.6.3 the Cleared Set Termination Amount will be an amount equal to the sum, but without duplication, of (A) the Aggregate Transaction Value, (B) any amount which became payable, or which would have become payable but for a condition precedent not being satisfied, in respect of any such Centrally Cleared Trade on or prior to the termination of such Centrally Cleared Trades but which remains unpaid at the time of such termination (expressed as a positive amount if such unpaid amount is due from us to you and as a negative amount if such unpaid amount is due from you to us) and (C) any other amount attributable to the relevant Centrally Cleared Trades under this Agreement, pro-rated where necessary if such amount can be partially attributed to Trades other than the relevant Centrally Cleared Trades, which was payable but unpaid at the time of termination and is not otherwise included in sub-paragraphs (A) or (B) (expressed as a positive amount if such unpaid amount is due from us to you and as a negative amount if such unpaid amount is due from you to us) together with, in the case of amounts referred to in sub-paragraphs (B) and (C), interest on such amounts in the same currency as such amount for the period from, and including, the original due date for payment to, but excluding, the date of termination, if applicable;</li>
          <li>17.6.4 if the Cleared Set Termination Amount is a positive number, it will be due from us to you and if a Cleared Set Termination Amount is a negative number, the absolute value of the Cleared Set Termination Amount will be due from you to us; and</li>
          <li>17.6.5 if, following a CIL Trigger Event, any CCP Transaction is Transferred from us to another clearing member of the Clearing House Service through which that CCP Transaction is Cleared along with all collateral or margin relating to such CCP Transaction which has been posted to the relevant Clearing House, pursuant to the Rule Set of such Clearing House Service, then for the purposes of clause 17.6.2, the value of the corresponding Centrally Cleared Trade shall be zero and for the purposes of clause 17.6.3(C), an amount equal to the value of the collateral or margin so transferred shall constitute an amount payable by you to us attributable to such Centrally Cleared Trade.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>17.7 If Centrally Cleared Trades are capable of being closed or terminated pursuant to both clause 16 and clause 17.6, then the clause in respect of which a party first exercises any right to close or terminate such Centrally Cleared Trades pursuant to which such Centrally Cleared Trades are otherwise closed or terminated, if earlier, will prevail for the purposes of the relevant Centrally Cleared Trades.</p>
        <br />
        <p>17.8 Without prejudice to clause 17.9 you will notify us as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware that (i) you have been, or will be, paid (or have otherwise received, or will otherwise receive credit for) any amount or (ii) you have received, or will receive any asset under the relevant Rule Set from a Clearing House in relation to a Clearing House Service in connection with one or more Centrally Cleared Trades and the related CCP Transactions.</p>
        <br />
        <p>17.9 If any amount has been paid, or is payable, by us to you (or you have otherwise received or will otherwise receive credit for any amount) or if any asset has been received, or shall be received, by you from a Clearing House in relation to an Agreed CCP Service under the relevant Rule Set and such amount or asset is attributable to amounts that would otherwise be determined and/or payable under this Agreement and is not otherwise already taken into account in the determination of amounts payable under this Agreement, we will make such adjustment to the payment or other terms of this Agreement (which may include, without limitation, an obligation on you to pay to us any amount (i) received by you from a Clearing House and/or (ii) corresponding to the value of an asset received by you from a Clearing House, that exceeds the amount due to you from us in respect of that Clearing House Service under this Agreement) as we determine appropriate to account for any Losses that we may otherwise incur as a result of such amount being paid, or payable, to you, or you otherwise receiving credit for such amount, or such asset being received, or to be received, by you from the relevant Clearing House. Following the receipt of an asset by you in the circumstances referred to in clause 17.9 above, and when making the necessary adjustments to the payment or other terms of this Agreement referred to above, we shall take into account, for the purposes of such adjustment, the value of the asset so received by you at the time that the Clearing House determines that such asset is to be transferred to you in accordance with the relevant Rule Set of that Clearing House (irrespective of when such asset is actually received by you).</p>

        <br />
        <p>18.3 Unrealized Profits and Losses that are denominated in another currency may be valued at or converted in notional terms to your Base Currency.

        <p>19.1 When a Corporate Action or an Insolvency Event occurs in relation to any Underlying Instrument and/or its issuer we may, acting in a commercially reasonable manner, adjust your Open Positions and/or Orders to reflect those actions and to put you in a position as close as possible to that of a direct holder of the Underlying Instrument. In the case of adjustments to Open Positions held in a Centrally Cleared Market, corresponding adjustments will be made (where appropriate) to the corresponding CCP Transactions.</p>
        <br />
        <p>19.2 The actions we may take pursuant to clause 19.1 include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>19.2.1 changing Margin Factors, Margin Multipliers and/or the minimum level of Guaranteed Stop Loss Orders both in relation to Open Positions and new Trades.</li>
          <li>19.2.2 making a reasonable and fair retrospective adjustment to the opening price of an Open Position, to reflect the impact of the relevant action or event.</li>

        <br />
        <p>19.3 We may make dividend adjustments if a dividend is scheduled to be paid to the holders of the Underlying Instrument. These adjustments are normally made on the ex-dividend date. Long Positions receive adjustments net of tax, whereas short positions are charged the declared amount of gross tax, where applicable.</p>
        <br />
        <p>19.4 We shall use best endeavors to take any such actions as soon as we are reasonably able to do so, and this will normally be as soon as is reasonably practicable after the relevant event has occurred.</p>
        <br />
        <p>19.5 When we adjust Open Positions, where possible we will adjust the Open Position as held by you to be effective from the commencement of Trading Hours on the same Business Day on which the relevant event or action is effective in relation to the Underlying Instrument.</p>
        <br />
        <p>19.6 Depending on the event concerned, we may take any of the actions set out in this clause 19 without prior notice. If we do so, we shall give you notice at the time we take the action or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.</p>

        <p>21.1 When you execute a Trade with us, we may buy or sell on securities exchanges or directly from or to other financial institutions shares or units in the relevant Underlying Instrument or financial instruments related to that Underlying Instrument. The result is that when you place Trades with us your Trades can have an impact on the external market for that Underlying Instrument in addition to the impact it might have on Our Price. This creates a possibility of market abuse, and the purpose of this clause is to prevent such abuse.</p>
        <br />
        <p>21.2 You represent and warrant to us at the time you enter into the Agreement and every time you enter into a Trade or give us any other instruction that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>21.2.1 you will not place and have not placed a Trade with us if to do so would result in you, or others with whom you are acting in concert having an interest in the price of the Underlying Instrument which is equal to or exceeds the amount of a Declarable Interest in the Underlying Instrument.</li>
          <li>21.2.2 you will not place, and have not placed a Trade in connection with:
            <ul>
              <li>a) a placing, issue, distribution, or other similar event; or</li>
              <li>b) an offer, takeover, merger, or other similar event; or</li>

        <p>21.3 In the event that you place any Trade in breach of the representations and warranties given in this clause 21 or any other clause of this Agreement or we have reasonable grounds for believing that you have done so, in addition to any rights we may have under clause 16, we may:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>21.3.1 enforce the Trade or Trade(s) against you if it is a Trade or Trades which results in you owing money to us.</li>
          <li>21.3.2 treat all your Trades as void if they are Trades which result in us owing money to you, unless and until you produce conclusive evidence within 30 days of our request that you have not in fact committed any breach of warranty, misrepresentation or undertaking under this Agreement.</li>
          <li>21.3.3 close your Account with immediate effect; and/or</li>
          <li>21.3.4 withhold any Realized Profits to the extent that we have reasonable grounds for believing that they are related to your breach of the representations and warranties given in this clause 21.</li>

        <p>21.4 You acknowledge that it would be improper for you to deal in the Underlying Instrument if the sole purpose of such a transaction was to manipulate Our Price, and you agree not to conduct any such transactions.</p>
        <br />
        <p>21.5 We are entitled (and in some cases required) to report to any relevant regulatory authority details of any Trade or Order. You may also be required to make appropriate disclosures and you undertake that you will do so where so required.</p>

        <p>22.4 As the price of our contracts depend on fluctuations in the Underlying Instrument which are outside our control and which may occur during the cancellation period, you have no rights to cancel this Agreement if any Trade placed by you has been executed before we receive notice of cancellation.</p>

      <br />

      <div class="text">
        <p><strong>Retail Clients</strong></p>
        <p>27.1 As a Retail Client, any money which you have transferred or transfer to us, or which has been transferred to us, which is to be held by us on your behalf, is Client Money within the meaning of the Client Money Rules, and will be held by us on trust for you at all times and for this purpose. In accordance with the requirements of the Client Money Rules, Client Money must be and will be segregated from our own money. In the event of our insolvency, Client Money will be excluded from the assets available to our creditors.</p>
        <br />
        <p>27.2 We may hold Client Money on your behalf in an account with a bank, or third party as permitted by Clause 27.5, which may be located in the United Kingdom or inside or outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Any such account will be segregated, and held in an account or accounts identified separately, from any account in which our own money or assets is held with the bank or third party, but where we hold Client Money with a third party pursuant to clause 27.5 it may be subject to set-off rights of that third party. The legal and regulatory regime applying to any bank, or third party located outside the United Kingdom will be different from that of the United Kingdom and in the event of the insolvency or any other equivalent failure of that bank or third party, your client Money may not be as effectively protected as if your client Money is held with an equivalent bank or third party in the United Kingdom.</p>
        <br />

        <p><strong>Professional Clients and Eligible Counterparties</strong></p>
        <p>27.3 If you have been classified as a Professional Client or an Eligible Counterparty, we will hold your money as Client Money in accordance with clauses 27.1 and 27.2 unless we have agreed in writing that clause 27.4 applies.</p>
        <p>27.4 Where this clause 27.4 applies, you agree that in relation to any money received by us from you, or received by us on your behalf:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>(a) full ownership of such money is transferred by you to us for the purpose of securing or covering all your present or future, actual or contingent, or prospective, obligations to us under this Agreement or otherwise;</li>
          <li>(b) we acquire full ownership of such money and we will not hold such money in accordance with the Client Money Rules;</li>
          <li>(c) you will have no proprietary claim over such money and we can deal with it as our own;</li>
          <li>(d) we will owe you a debt equal to the amount of such money received by us, subject to any set-off rights under, or other terms of, this Agreement, or under general law;</li>
          <li>(e) in the event of our insolvency you will rank as a general creditor of ours in relation to such money;</li>
          <li>(f) we shall pay to you all or part of any amount owed by us to you under this clause to the extent that we consider, in our discretion, that the amount of money you have transferred to us exceeds the amount required by us to secure or cover all your present or future, actual or contingent, or prospective, obligations to us under this Agreement or otherwise;</li>
          <li>(g) we shall be obliged to pay to you all amounts owed by us to you under this clause upon the earliest of:
            <ul>
              <li>(i) termination of the title transfer arrangement in accordance with this clause;</li>
              <li>(ii) termination of this Agreement under clause 29; or</li>
              <li>(iii) exercise by us of our rights under clause 17, in each case subject to any set-off rights under, or other terms of, this Agreement.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <p><strong>Centrally Cleared Trades</strong></p>
        <p>27.5 You acknowledge and confirm that in relation to Centrally Cleared Trades, we may allow the relevant Clearing House hold any amount of your money, which is held by us as Client Money within the meaning of the Client Money Rules for the purpose of one or more of your Trades through or with that Clearing House or to meet our obligations to provide any margin to such Clearing House in relation to the CCP Transactions. Your client Money which is transferred to the Clearing House may be dealt with by that Clearing House in accordance with the applicable Rule Set, which may grant the Clearing House a security interest or set-off rights over such money.</p>
        <p>27.6 In relation to a General Account, your client Money, or, where clause 27.4 applies, money transferred by you to us, but which relates to your Centrally Cleared Trades, that is transferred to a Clearing House will be held by the Clearing House in a consolidated segregated client transaction account for our clients that may not be combined with any other account. In relation to an ISCA Account, your client Money, or, where clause 27.4 applies, money transferred by you to us, but which relates to your Centrally Cleared Trades, that is transferred to a Clearing House will be held by the Clearing House in an individually consolidated segregated client transaction account for you that may not be combined with any other account. The Clearing House will have no right to set-off against the client transaction account any amounts owing to the Clearing House on any other account. If you are interested in an individual segregated account, please contact Client Management.</p>
        <br />

        <p><strong>Fixed term deposits</strong></p>
        <p>27.7 Where we consider it appropriate to do so and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, we may from time to time hold a proportion of the total Client Money that we hold for our clients in relation to a particular line of business in an account from which we will be unable to make a withdrawal until the expiry of a fixed term or notice period. We will take appropriate measures, including in setting the relevant proportion, to allow us to return Client Money to our clients promptly as and when required to do so in the ordinary course of business. However, there is a risk that in exceptional circumstances (for example, where there is unusually high Client Money outflows) your money may not be immediately available, and you may have to wait until the expiry of a fixed term or notice period before we can return some or all of the Client Money that we hold for you.</p>
        <br />

        <p><strong>Money market funds</strong></p>
        <p>27.8 We may from time to time hold Client Money in a ‘qualifying money market fund’ (as such term is defined in the Client Money Rules). Where we hold Client Money in a qualifying money market fund it will not be held in accordance with the requirements for holding Client Money. However, we will hold the relevant units or shares that we are issued in such funds in accordance with the applicable LFSA Rules. You hereby explicitly consent to the placement of your Client Money in a qualifying money market fund.</p>
        <br />

        <p><strong>General</strong></p>
        <p>27.9 Where any bank, Clearing House or other permitted third party holds money under this clause 27:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>(a) we will not be liable for the acts or omissions of, or failure or insolvency or any analogous event affecting, such entity; and</li>
          <li>(b) in the event of the insolvency or other analogous proceeding in relation to such entity, we may have only an unsecured claim against such entity on behalf of you and our other clients, and you may be exposed to the risk that the money recovered by us from such entity is insufficient to satisfy the claims of you and all other clients with claims in respect of the relevant account. However, if your money is held within an EEA country, a proportion of your money may qualify for compensation arrangements in that jurisdiction.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>27.10 We do not pay interest on any Client Money, or money that you transfer to us under clause 27.4, unless we have expressly agreed to do so in writing.</p>
        <br />

        <p>27.11 You will not grant any security interest over any Client Money held in your Account, or any claim against us for money due to you under clause 27.4, to any person other than us.</p>
        <br />

        <p>27.12 Where any amounts owed by you to us under the Agreement are due and payable to us, in accordance with the Client Money Rules we shall cease to treat as Client Money so much of any Client Money held on your behalf as equals those amounts. You agree that we may apply that money in or towards satisfaction of all or part of those amounts due and payable to us. For the purposes of this clause, any such amounts owed by you to us under this Agreement become immediately due and payable, without notice or demand by us, when incurred by you or on your behalf.</p>
        <br />

        <p>27.13 You agree that where there has been no movement on your Client Money balance for a period of at least six years (disregarding any payment or receipt of interest, charges or similar items), we may pay such Client Money to the registered charity of our choice:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>(a) provided that we have taken reasonable steps to trace you and to return the Client Money balance, and in such case we hereby unconditionally undertake that, where any of your Client Money has been paid to charity in accordance with this sub-clause (a), and you subsequently claim against us for such amount of Client Money, we shall pay to you a sum equal to the amount paid to charity; or</li>
          <li>(b) where the amount of Client Money is GBP 25 or less if you are a Retail Client or GBP 100 or less in any other case, provided we have made at least one attempt to contact you to return the Client Money balance, using the most up-to-date contact details we have for you, and you have not responded to such communication within 28 days of the last communication having been made.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <p>27.14 We may transfer any money we hold for you as Client Money (after deduction of any amounts permitted by the terms of this Customer Agreement) to another legal entity (including any of our group companies) where we transfer all or part of our business to that entity and your client Money relates to the business transferred. Where we transfer your Client Money to another legal entity under this clause we shall require that such Client Money will be held by that entity for you in accordance with the Client Money Rules, or, if that legal entity will not hold your Client Money in accordance with the Client Money Rules, we will exercise all due skill, care and diligence in assessing whether that legal entity will apply adequate measures to protect your Client Money.</p>
        <br />

        <p>27.15 You agree that we shall be entitled to treat Client Money as due and payable to us, to the extent of all or any part of the obligations owed by you to us under this Agreement which are due and payable to us but unpaid.</p>
        <br />

        <p>27.16 In this clause 27, “Client Money Rules” means the provisions of the LFSA’s Client Assets Sourcebook, as amended and/or updated from time to time.</p>

        <p>29.1 We may amend or replace any clause or part of the Agreement in whole or in part by giving you written notification of the changes. Amendments to this Agreement will not be valid and binding unless they are expressly agreed by us in writing. We will only make changes for good reason including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>29.1.1 making them clearer or more favorable to you.</li>
          <li>29.1.2 reflecting legitimate changes in the cost of providing the service to you.</li>

          <li>29.1.5 reflecting changes in the way we do business.</li>

        <br />

        <p>29.2 If you object to any change you must tell us within 14 days of the date the notice is deemed received by you under clause 32 ("Notices"). If you do not do so you will be deemed to have accepted the change(s). If you give us notice that you object, then the changes will not be binding on you, but we may require you to close your Account as soon as reasonably practicable and/or restrict you to placing Trades and/or Orders to close your Open Positions.</p>
        <br />

        <p>29.3 Subject to clause 29.2 the amendments or new terms made pursuant to this clause 29 will apply (including to all Open Positions and unexecuted Orders) from the effective date (which we will state) of the change specified in the notice.</p>

        <p>29.4 In addition to any other rights specified in this Agreement, we may cease to offer a Product or end this Agreement and close your Account at any time by giving you 14 days’ written notice. This is in addition to any other rights to end this Agreement and/or close your Account which we may have. In the event that we cease to offer a Product or a Market, you shall agree to close any Open Positions relating to such Product or Market during the 14-day notice period unless otherwise instructed by us. After the 14-day notice period, your Open Positions in relation to such Product or Market will be automatically closed out.</p>
        <br />

        <p>29.5 You may also end the Agreement and/or close your Account at any time, in whole or in part, by giving us written notice.

        <p>29.6 Where either you or we provide notice to close your Account and/or end this Agreement under this clause 29, we reserve the right to refuse to allow you to enter into any further Trades or Orders which may lead to you holding further Open Positions.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <p>30.1 A court or regulatory authority may decide that a part or clause of this Agreement is not enforceable. If this happens then the relevant part of the Agreement will be given no effect and will not be considered part of the Agreement. This will not invalidate any other clause or part of the Agreement.</p>
        <br />

        <p>30.2 You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under this Agreement without our prior written consent. We may assign or transfer all or any of our rights or obligations under this Agreement to any of our Associated Companies or to any person authorized in the United Kingdom or any EEA member state on 30 days’ written notice. We will comply with LFSA Rules or any other applicable rule which may apply to this transfer, including obtaining your or any other party’s consent where necessary.</p>
        <br />

        <p>30.3 Either you or we may elect not to require the other party to comply with this Agreement or may delay requiring the other party to do so. This will not amount to a waiver by the party making such election of its rights under this Agreement unless that party clearly states that this is its intention. This means that the relevant party can still require compliance with the Agreement in future.</p>
        <br />

        <p>30.4 Except as provided by clauses 24, 25, 26 and 30.5, no clause of this Agreement is intended to confer any benefit on any person who is not a party to it or to be enforceable under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.</p>
