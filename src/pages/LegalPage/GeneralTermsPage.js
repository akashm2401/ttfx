        <p>We provide services for trading derivative financial contracts. Our contracts are traded on a margin or leveraged basis, a type of trading which carries a high degree of risk to your capital. The price of the contract you make with us may change quickly and your profits and losses may be more than the amount of your investment or funds. If you do not have sufficient funds to meet your margin requirements, then we may close your open positions immediately and without notice. Please read the Risk Warning Notice carefully to understand the risks of trading on a margin or leverage basis. You should not deal in our contracts unless you understand and accept the risks of margin trading. Trading in these products may not be suitable for everyone.</p>

      <br />

      <div className="text">
        <p>
          2.1	Our trading service is an electronic service, and you specifically consent to us communicating with you by email, by SMS, by letter or telephone and/or by any other electronic means or methods agreed in writing. We will not send a paper form of any communication sent to you unless you request us to do so. We reserve the right to charge for communications and/or documents sent to you in a paper form.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          2.2	You confirm that you have regular access to the internet and consent to us providing you with information about us and our services (including the Market Information), our costs and charges, information about our Products, our Notices and Policies and any other information that we are required to provide to you pursuant to LFSA Rules by email or by posting such information on our website or the Trading Platform. This is without prejudice to any rights you may have to request copies of the information or, by notifying us in writing, to receive such information in hard copy, rather than by email or other electronic means. We reserve the right to charge for information and/or documents sent to you in a paper form.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          2.3	Unless we notify you otherwise, we will classify you as a Retail Client for the purpose of LFSA Rules. You have a right to request a different categorization but if we agree to this request, you will lose the protection of certain LFSA Rules. In certain circumstances we may wish to re-categories you, but if we do so we will explain clearly why we are doing this and the effect this will have on your protections and compensation rights.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          2.4	We will deal with you as principal and not as agent on your behalf. This means that any Trades are agreed directly between you and us and we will be the counterparty to all of your Trades.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          2.5	Unless we agree otherwise in writing, you will also deal with us as principal and not as an agent or representative of another person. You will not permit any person to deal on your behalf unless we agree that such person (the “Agent”) can act on your behalf. We will be entitled to rely on any instructions given to us by the Agent in relation to your Account. We may require confirmation that the Agent has authority to act on your behalf at any time we reasonably consider appropriate
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          2.6	In order to ensure that we can deal with you and discharge our obligations under applicable laws and regulations, you will provide us, as appropriate, with your legal entity identifier (“LEI”) (provided you are eligible for one) or such other information relating to, for example, your nationality as we will require to determine your national client identifier.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          2.7	We shall not give advice to you on the merits of any Trade and shall deal with you on an execution-only basis. None of our staff are authorized by us or permitted under LFSA Rules to give you investment advice. Accordingly, you should not regard any proposed trades, suggested trading strategies or other written or oral communications from us as investment recommendations or advice or as expressing our view as to whether a particular trade is suitable for you or meets your financial objectives. You must rely on your own judgement for any investment decision you make in relation to your Account. If you require investment or tax advice, please contact an independent investment or tax adviser.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          2.8	You will not have any rights of ownership, delivery or otherwise in any Underlying Instrument as a result of a Trade with us. We will not transfer any Underlying Instrument or any rights (such as voting rights or delivery obligations) in it to you.
